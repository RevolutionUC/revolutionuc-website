        <p>RevolutionUC is a student hackathon in which we invite students from across the midwest to partake in a weekend of code, community, and self-improvement. You don't have to attend the University of Cincinnati and you don't have to be a computer science major or engineering student. We're looking for people who share our passion to do awesome things with technology.</p>

        <p>At the core of RevolutionUC are three key concepts: building, learning, and growing. There's nothing we love more than helping our hackers learn something new while they build something cool. RevolutionUC strives to be an event where students who are passionate about technology can come together to create something amazing. New to hackathons? No problem! We're excited to help you dive into the fantastic community, and there's no better place to start than RevolutionUC! With experienced and industry mentors, you'll be hacking away in no time!</p>

        <p>Over the course of 24 hours you'll work together with friends, new or old, to create something you can be proud of from scratch. With tech talks and industry partnerships for inspiration, the sky is the limit. We've seen fantastic websites, mobile apps, bots, and hardware hacks, and we can't wait to see what you'll make this year.</p>

        <p>Hackathons are more than just a competition or showcase of technical skill. At RevolutionUC, we strive to create an all-inclusive community that acts as an outlet in which we can join our peers and share our passion for all the incredible things that can be done through programming. That's why we follow the <a href="https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf" target="_blank">Major League Hacking code of conduct</a>. We’re excited to share this ethos with all of our attendees and come together to grow the hacker community here in Cincinnati.</p>
